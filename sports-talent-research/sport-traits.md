# Sport Traits and Correlation Summary

Correlation strength legend: **High** (strong direct linkage), **Moderate** (meaningful but not decisive), **Low** (contextual or indirect). All assume **current ability** and role-specific demands.

## Athletics: sprinting (100m–400m)

- Correlation strength: **High** for power/sprint metrics

## Athletics: middle-distance (800m–1500m)
- Key traits: aerobic capacity, running economy, lactate threshold, speed endurance
- Common tests: VO2max, lactate threshold, 300–600m repeats, HR recovery
- Correlation strength: **Moderate–High** (physiology + efficiency)

## Athletics: long-distance (3k–marathon)

## Soccer
- Key traits: repeated sprint ability, aerobic capacity, agility, acceleration, lower-body power
- Common tests: Yo-Yo IR, 5–30m sprint, agility/COD, CMJ
- Correlation strength: **Moderate** (skills and tactics add large variance)

- Key traits: height/wingspan, vertical power, agility, repeated sprint
- Common tests: standing reach, CMJ, lane agility, 3/4 court sprint
- Correlation strength: **Moderate–High** for anthropometrics and power

## Baseball

- Common tests: med-ball throws, bat swing speed, grip strength
- Correlation strength: **Moderate** (skill/technique dominant)

## American football
- Key traits: size/mass by position, acceleration, strength, power
- Common tests: 10–40m sprint, bench/squat, vertical jump
- Correlation strength: **Moderate–High** (position-specific)

## Swimming (sprint)
- Key traits: upper-body power, anaerobic capacity, body length, shoulder mobility
- Common tests: 25–50m splits, tethered swim power, dryland power
- Correlation strength: **Moderate–High**

## Rowing
- Key traits: aerobic capacity, power endurance, limb length, body mass

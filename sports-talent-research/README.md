# Sports Talent Research (Physical Traits Focus)

## Purpose
Provide a practical, evidence-aligned reference for mapping physical traits to sport performance potential, using publicly available datasets, existing products, and research consensus. Focus is **current ability** (not growth prediction), with notes for both youth and adult contexts.

## Scope
- Physical and physiological predictors (anthropometry, strength, power, speed, endurance).
- Biological markers available from common testing (VO2max, lactate thresholds, HR recovery).
- Limited genetic context, emphasizing current scientific consensus on low predictive utility.
- Sports list (~20) with qualitative correlation strength for key traits.

## Key conclusions (current consensus)
- **Physical traits can meaningfully differentiate performance within a sport**, but predictive power is moderate and highly sport- and role-specific.
- **Anthropometrics and neuromuscular power** show strong relationships in sports with clear biomechanical constraints (e.g., sprinting, rowing, weightlifting).
- **Endurance capacity** (VO2max, thresholds) strongly correlates within endurance-dominant sports, but not sufficient alone.
- **Genetic testing is not currently reliable** for predicting sport performance or talent identification; professional consensus discourages consumer prediction products.
- **Multi-modal models** (physical tests + training history + skill measures) are the frontier, yet accuracy is still limited by data quality, sampling bias, and contextual factors.

## Frontier research (practical view)
- **Multi-modal talent ID models**: combine anthropometrics, physical tests, and longitudinal training data; strongest when sport- and role-specific.
- **Wearable-derived physiology**: time-series features (HRV, recovery kinetics) for profiling readiness and endurance traits.
- **Biomechanics + force-plate signatures**: force-time curves and asymmetry profiles to refine power and injury risk.
- **Genomics + polygenic scores**: active research, but current effect sizes and reproducibility are insufficient for individual prediction.

## What this folder contains
- `datasets.md`: public datasets with variables, populations, and access notes.
- `products.md`: existing products/services and their evidence posture.
- `sport-traits.md`: per-sport breakdown of physical traits and correlation strength.
- `methods.md`: evaluation pipeline and limitations.
- `sources.md`: citations and links.

## Market consensus (summary)
Most high-credibility solutions position themselves as **performance monitoring and development** tools rather than deterministic talent predictors. Genetic testing is typically marketed for wellness or training personalization; sport performance prediction claims are widely criticized by sport science bodies.

# Evaluation Methods and Caveats

## Suggested evaluation pipeline (current ability)
1. **Baseline anthropometrics**: height, mass, limb lengths, wingspan, body composition.
2. **Strength and power**: 1RM estimates, jump tests, peak power, sprint splits.
3. **Speed and agility**: 5–30m sprints, COD tests, reactive agility where possible.
4. **Aerobic/anaerobic capacity**: VO2max or field proxies (Yo-Yo, 12-min run), lactate threshold if available.
5. **Sport-specific tests**: technical battery tailored to sport (serve speed, stroke power, etc.).
6. **Contextual inputs**: training age, injury history, role/position demands.

## Interpreting results
- Use **sport-specific normalization** and age/sex stratification.
- Prefer **role-specific** scoring (e.g., center vs guard, sprinter vs distance runner).
- Combine metrics into **profiles**, not single-number predictions.

## Accuracy limits
- Physical tests explain **meaningful but incomplete** variance; skill and coaching effects are large.
- Youth testing is sensitive to maturation timing and selection bias.
- Genetics currently adds **minimal actionable accuracy**.

## Ethics and safeguards
- Avoid deterministic labels; emphasize **exploration and development**.
- Obtain informed consent; protect minors’ data.
- Monitor for **selection bias** and **relative age effects**.

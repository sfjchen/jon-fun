# Products and Services Landscape

## 1) Physical testing and monitoring platforms
These focus on **measurement and progression**, not deterministic talent prediction.
- **Force plate / jump testing platforms**: measure power, asymmetry, RSI, takeoff velocity  
  - Examples: Vald ForceDecks, Kistler, Hawkin Dynamics  
- **Speed and agility timing systems**: sprint splits, COD tests  
  - Examples: Brower Timing, Freelap, Fusion Sport  
- **Strength assessment systems**: 1RM tracking, bar velocity  
  - Examples: Vitruve, GymAware, Tendo  

## 2) Wearables and athlete monitoring
Used for training load, recovery, and physiological profiling.
- **GPS + workload platforms** (team sports)  
  - Examples: Catapult, STATSports  
- **Heart-rate + recovery**  
  - Examples: Polar, Garmin, WHOOP, Oura  

## 3) Talent ID and athlete management systems
Often integrate testing data, scouting notes, and athlete tracking.
- Examples: Smartabase, Kitman Labs, Teamworks  
- Evidence posture: strong on **data integration**, limited on **predictive validity**.

## 4) Genetic testing for sport performance
Consumer products exist but **consensus discourages predictive claims**.
- Examples (historical/consumer-facing): DNAfit, Athletigen, 24Genetics  
- Evidence posture: small effect sizes for known variants; high heterogeneity in studies.

## Market consensus
- The most credible offerings position themselves as **performance monitoring** tools.  
- Direct-to-consumer “sport potential” claims are widely criticized by sport science bodies.

# Datasets (Public/Accessible)

Note: Many sport datasets are small, sport-specific, or restricted. Below are accessible datasets useful for physiological/anthropometric analysis or as anchors for feature engineering.

## Cardiorespiratory and physiology
- **Treadmill Maximal Exercise Tests (University of Malaga, PhysioNet)**  
  - Measures: VO2, VCO2, ventilation, HR, workload, demographics  
  - Population: mixed athletes, ages ~10-63  
  - Use: VO2max, ventilatory thresholds, recovery metrics

- **Sport DB 2.0 (Mendeley Data)**  
  - Measures: ECG, HR series, RR intervals, breathing rate, demographics  
  - Population: 130 subjects, 11 sports  
  - Use: wearable sensor modeling, cardio markers by sport

## Anthropometry + performance
- **NBA Wingspan & Performance (ScoreNetwork)**  
  - Measures: height, wingspan, wingspan advantage, per-100 possession stats  
  - Population: 2024-25 NBA season players  
  - Use: anthropometry vs in-game performance metrics  
  - Link: https://data.scorenetwork.org/basketball/nba_wingspans_and_performance.html

- **Soccer forward players by age category (Figshare)**  
  - Measures: height, body mass, vertical jump, sprint tests, aerobic capacity  
  - Population: youth to adult, position-specific  
  - Use: age/level comparisons within position

## Broader sources to consider (often restricted)
- **Professional team combine/testing archives** (NBA, NFL, NHL combine style data)  
  - Measures: sprint, agility, jump, strength, anthropometrics  
  - Often partially public and uneven in coverage.

- **National sport institute talent ID batteries**  
  - Typically restricted; sometimes published in research supplements.

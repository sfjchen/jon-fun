- Always plan the code before writing it.
- After edits: update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for significant changes; update [README.md](README.md) if games/DB/API/architecture changed.
- Think about how the new code will fit into the existing codebase.
- Think about how the new code will interact with the other parts of the codebase.
- Think about how the new code will handle errors and edge cases.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the frontend.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the users.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the developer (me).

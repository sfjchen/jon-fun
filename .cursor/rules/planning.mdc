- Always plan the code before writing it.
- When suggesting packages, APIs, or frameworks: check official docs or web search for the latest versions before suggesting.
- Consider the current date when recommending best practices, deprecations, or version-specific behavior.
- After edits: update README (Changelog section for significant changes; Games/DB/API sections if those changed).
- Think about how the new code will fit into the existing codebase.
- Think about how the new code will interact with the other parts of the codebase.
- Think about how the new code will handle errors and edge cases.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the frontend.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the users.
- Think about how the new code will be used by the developer (me).

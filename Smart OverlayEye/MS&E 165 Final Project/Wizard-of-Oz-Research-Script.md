# Wizard of Oz User Research Script — Pear AI Step Navigator

Use this script to run 2–5 validation sessions with creatives (per Theresa's feedback). Capture quotes for the MVP presentation's Problem Definition + Research section.

## Setup

- **Operator**: One team member watches the user's screen (shared or in-person) and types/speaks the "next step" onto a tablet or second screen.
- **User**: Performs the task in their real app (Photoshop, Figma, Lightroom, etc.) as if the system were real.
- **Observer**: Takes notes and records quotes.

## Pre-session (2 min)

"Thanks for helping. We're testing a concept: a tablet that shows step-by-step guidance while you work in a creative app. I'll act as the 'AI' and give you the next step—you tell me when you're done and I'll give the next one. There's no wrong answer; we're learning what helps."

## Task (pick one per session)

1. **Remove background** (Photoshop/GIMP)
2. **Color grade a photo** (Lightroom/Luminar)
3. **Export a frame** (Figma/Sketch)

Ask: "What would you normally do for [task]? Let's do that—I'll guide you."

## During session

- Operator provides steps one at a time (use pre-written step list for the chosen task).
- When user completes a step: "Got it. Next: [step]."
- If stuck: offer hint, then full step.
- Note: time per step, backtracking, confusion points.

## Post-session questions (5 min)

1. "Compared to your usual way (YouTube, docs, trial-and-error), how did this feel?"
2. "What would make you actually use this?"
3. "Would you pay for it? How much, or as part of what?"
4. "What's the one thing that would make you stop using it?"

## Quote capture

Record verbatim quotes for:
- Friction with current help (problem validation)
- Reaction to guided flow (solution validation)
- "Would use" / "wouldn't use" (desirability)

Example format: *"I always get lost in Photoshop menus—this would save me 10 minutes."* — Creative, 22
